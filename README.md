# Spam Detection using NLP and Deep Learning

This project implements an **spam detection model** for text messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a deep learning architecture built with TensorFlow. The model classifies messages as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam) with high accuracy, leveraging a Bidirectional LSTM-based approach to capture contextual patterns in text data.

The dataset used is the **SMS Spam Collection** from Kaggle, containing 5,572 labeled sms messages. This project demonstrates how to preprocess text, build a sophisticated neural network, and evaluate its performance for real-world spam detection tasks.
